run in terminal

python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000


Whats venv?

This creates a virtual environment named .venv inside the project folder. This keeps libraries isolated from your global Python installation. So intead of installing packages system-wide (which can conflict across projects), we are able to get a localbox. 

.venv/
├── bin/          ← executables like python, pip
├── lib/          ← site-packages (installed libs)
└── pyvenv.cfg

Allowing us to:
• Keeps your FastAPI + Oracle packages separate from global Python.
• Prevents breaking other Python apps on your system.

To exit the environment:

deactivate




Whats univcorn?

Uvicorn is the ASGI web server that runs your FastAPI app (backend server). Its lightweight and fast. Think of it as a "engine" that servers your Python API to the web. 

app:app
this part tells Univcorn where to find your FastAPI application inside the code. As our project has "app.py" where it states inside: app = FastAPI()
This would change if it was "main.py" and inside the code it was: api = FastAPI(). Then we use main:api
