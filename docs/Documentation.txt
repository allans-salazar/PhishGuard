• Mobile app: React Native (Expo) in VS Code — quickest path to Android simulator + clean UI.
• Backend API: Python FastAPI (since you’re comfy with Python)
• Database: Your Oracle Docker via cx_Oracle
• Auth: JWT (email/password)
• Payment (simulated): In-app “credits” + fake transactions stored in DB
• AI agent: Backend endpoint that forwards questions to a provider (plug in your API key later)


Why this stack? Expo lets you stay in VS Code without heavy Android Studio plumbing at first. FastAPI is fast to code, easy to document (auto-docs), and cx_Oracle connects cleanly to your Oracle container.

• Always open VS Code at PhishGuard_Project/phishguard when working on the app. If you open the outer folder, Metro may pick up the wrong node_modules/paths.
• Always run npx expo start inside phishguard/ (the inner app).
